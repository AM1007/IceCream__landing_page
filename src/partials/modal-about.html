    <p class="modal-about-text">
      Ice cream is a sweetened frozen food typically eaten as a snack or
      dessert. It may be made from milk or cream and is flavoured with a
      sweetener, either sugar or an alternative, and a spice, such as cocoa or
      vanilla, or with fruit such as strawberries or peaches. It can also be
      made by whisking a flavored cream base and liquid nitrogen together. Food
      coloring is sometimes added, in addition to stabilizers. The mixture is
      cooled below the freezing point of water and stirred to incorporate air
      spaces and to prevent detectable ice crystals from forming. The result is
      a smooth, semi-solid foam that is solid at very low temperatures (below 2
      °C or 35 °F). It becomes more malleable as its temperature increases.
